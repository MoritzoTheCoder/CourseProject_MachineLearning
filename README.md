# CourseProject_MaschineLearning
This repo was created as part of the course project submission in the Practicle Maschine Learning Class on Coursera.

The **RMarkdown file** can be viewed from within GitHub.

The corresponding **HTML file** was created using knitter from within R. Unfortunately, within GitHub it can be displayed only as raw file. To view it as a rendered webpage, follow those instructions:

Either clone the repo or (better option): 
- **open the html file on github**, 
- **click on raw** (top right corner), 
- **copy the content**, 
- **open your superior text editor** (notepad++, textWrangler, ...), 
- **paste the content**, 
- **save it with an html extension**, then 
- **open it in your browser** and...
- you'll see it properly.

(if that doesn't work.. well you'll need to clone the repo and open the html file from your local machine)
